# Basic GAN Project on Fashion-Mnist
This project contains basic implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network on pytorch. It is written to understand code side of GANs.

## Usage
-- TODO: how to run code

## Train results
-- TODO: add train results 

## GAN
A GAN has 2 parts:
1. Generator: this learns to generate a reasonable data
2. Discriminator: this learns to distinguish the fake and real data

As generator generates a data discriminator distinguishes if it is fake or real. When discriminator detects a fake data, it punishes the generator through backward propogation. As training goes, generator learns how to generate realistic data and discriminator starts to fail detecting fake. 

## Next Steps
-- TODO: add how to advance this project
